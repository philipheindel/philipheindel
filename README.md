### Hello there 

My name is Philip Heindel. I work as a Software Engineer II at Idemia Identity & Security providing support and continuing development on legacy applications and systems. 

I studied Comptuer Science with a focus on Software Engineering at Purdue University Fort Wayne. In 2020, I earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science.

Outside of my job as a Software Engineer, I still engineer software. For a while I have been curious about the technical side of game development, so currently I am learning the [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) game engine by making a simple platformer game. Along with I also administer several home servers hosted on a Proxmox hypervisor.

<!--
Outside of my job as a Software Engineer, my main software development focus is on developing a Python based API with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) for managing dedicated Minecraft game servers I setup with [LinuxGSM](https://linuxgsm.com/). Once I have the API completed, I then plan to develop a web app using React that would interface with the API for maanging the server. Both of these projects were partially started as avenues to learn Python (and FastAPI) as well as React.
